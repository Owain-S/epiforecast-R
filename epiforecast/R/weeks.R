##'
##' Covers four common week numbering conventions:
##' \itemize{
##'  \item{"epi": }{Epidemiological weeks or "epi weeks": weeks begin on Sunday,
##'  and are assigned to years based on what year the majority of days fall in
##'  (i.e., what year Wednesday falls in)}
##'  \item{"iso": }{ISO 8601 weeks: weeks begin on Monday, and are assigned to
##'  years based on what year the majority of days fall in (i.e., what year
##'  Thursday falls in)}
##'  \item{"usa": }{USA convention: weeks begin on Sunday, and are assigned to
##'  years based on what year Sunday falls in}
##'  \item{"uk": }{UK convention: weeks begin on Monday, and are assigned to years
##'  based on what year Monday falls in}
##' }
##'
##' There are two rows, named \code{"first.wday"} and \code{"owning.wday"}.
##' There are four columns, corresponding to the four conventions above.
