##' @param baseline a "baseline level"  for this dataset; roughly speaking, data
##'     below this  level does not grow  like an epidemic; currently  ignored by
##'     most or all sim methods, but  can be used as the \code{y.scale.baseline}
##'     in \code{eb.sim}  in \code{epiforecast.cpp14funs} by passing  it through
##'     the \code{control.list} argument.
